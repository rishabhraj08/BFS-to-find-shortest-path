# BFS-to-find-shortest-path betwwen two points.

used breadth first algorithm to find shortest path in a maze consisting of obstacles.
also graphical visualization is there to see the actual path.
Assumed that the distance of moving fom one point to its adjacent points is unit

Need graphics.h file to run the code
